Spatial matching was based on parcel centroids. Older properties may be missing latitude and longitude data because they are not contained in the most recent parcel shape layer. Brand new properties may be missing a mailing/property address because the postal service has not yet assigned the property an address. Data attached to each PIN is the most recent available. For example, Census tract data is drawn from the 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey.\n\nThe code and sources used to construct this data can be located on GitLab.
